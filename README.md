The Minibadge includes a spiffy DC801 design and two automatic slow-cycling RGB LEDs

The Minibadge can be used in two ways:

1. SAINTCON Minibadge Mode
2. Shirt Pin Mode

# Instructions for SAINTCON Minibadge Mode

1) Insert the LEDs into the back of the board with the shorter legs toward the top
2) Bend the legs of the LEDs over to contact the pads
3) Trim legs to pads and solder
4) Pick a resistor and solder R1:
   0 - Brightest, 20-55mA
   470 - Bright, 3-4mA
   1k - Not so bright, 1.5-2mA
5) Break the pin headers to fit 
6) Cut the sockets into two 8 pin sockets 
7) Insert the sockets with pins into your SAINTCON badge
8) Place the DC801 Minibadge onto the pins and solder
9) Flip your SAINTCON badge over and solder on the sockets

# Instructions for Shirt Pin Mode

1) Follow above, but donâ€™t use the pin headers
2) Solder included button pin to large pad at top

Hope you enjoy!
